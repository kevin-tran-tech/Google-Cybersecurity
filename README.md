## Overview

I have successfully completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** through Coursera. This program covered foundational cybersecurity topics and included hands-on projects designed to prepare me for exploring more advanced topics in computer security.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed
At the end of this program, I have developed the following skills:

- **Documentation** for security processes and incident response
- **SQL** for managing databases and querying data
- **Linux** for managing and securing systems
- **Python** for automating cybersecurity tasks
- **Network Security** including analyzing network attacks and OS hardening
- **Incident Response** through filling out structured incident response templates, documenting timelines, threat assessments, and mitigation strategies
- **Conducting security audits** by filling out checklists and providing recommendations
- **Vulnerability assessments** for conducting risk assessment and remediation strategy
