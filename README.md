## Introduction

I have successfully completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** through Coursera. This program covered essential cybersecurity topics and hands-on projects designed to prepare me for entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Developed
At the end of this program, I have developed the following skills:

- **Documentation** for security processes and incident response
- **SQL** for managing databases and querying data
- **Linux** for managing and securing systems
- **Python** for automating cybersecurity tasks
- **Network Security** including analyzing network attacks and OS hardening
- **Incident Response** through filling out structured incident response templates, documenting timelines, threat assessments, and mitigation strategies.
- **conducting security audits**
