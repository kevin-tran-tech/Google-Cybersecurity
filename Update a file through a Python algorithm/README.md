## Portfolio Activity: Update a file through a Python algorithm

### Activity Overview

In this activity, I have demonstrated my experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. I reviewed the following scenario and accessed the supporting materials to complete [report](https://github.com/kevin-tran-tech/Google-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Update%20a%20file%20through%20a%20Python%20algorithm/Algorithm%20for%20file%20updates%20in%20Python%20.pdf) from an activity I have completed.

### Supporting Materials

- [Instructions for including Python code](https://github.com/kevin-tran-tech/Google-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Update%20a%20file%20through%20a%20Python%20algorithm/Instructions%20for%20including%20Python%20code.pdf)

### Scenario

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.
