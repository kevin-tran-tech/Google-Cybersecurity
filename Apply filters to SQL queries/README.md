## Portfolio Activity: Apply filters to SQL queries

### Activity Oveview

In this activity, I had to ensure that the organization's system is safe. I investigated potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. I read the following scenario and read the supporting materials to complete my report on [Apply filters to SQL queries](https://github.com/kevin-tran-tech/Google-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.pdf).

### Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
