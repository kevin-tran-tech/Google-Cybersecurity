## Portfolio Activity: Conduct a security audit

### üìã Overview

In this activity, I conducted an internal audit of a fictional company called "Botium Toys" by reviewing the [IT manager‚Äôs scope, goals, and risk assessment report](https://github.com/kevin-tran-tech/Google-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Conduct%20a%20security%20audit/Botium%20Toys%20-%20Scope%2C%20goals%2C%20and%20risk%20assessment%20report.pdf). I then carried out an internal audit by completing a [controls and compliance checklist](https://github.com/kevin-tran-tech/Google-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Conduct%20a%20security%20audit/Controls%20and%20compliance%20checklist.pdf).

### üè¢ Scenario
<i>This scenario is based on a fictional company:</i>

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy‚Äôs online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company‚Äôs infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.
